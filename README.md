# BioinformaticsLabReports
This repository contains lab reports written to summarize mini projects completed in my senior year advanced bioinformatics lab course at University of California San Diego in which I received an A+.

## Labs
**Lab1:** Mutations and Mechanisms of Ampicillin Resistant E. Coli: A Sequence Analysis Investigation

**Lab2:** Molecular Investigator: Deep Sequencing Variant Identification for Classifying Mutations in Flu Virus Allowing for Transmission to Vaccinated Hosts

**Lab3:** De Novo Assembly Pipeline: Building Staphylococcus Genome from Short Reads

**Lab4:** Investigation of Developmental and Shh Gene Regulatory Regions: A Differential Expression Analysis of RNA+ChIP-Sequencing Data

**Lab5:** Can Reading Ones Genome Provide Information On Who They Are: An Investigation of Eye Color Using GWAS and Mathematical Modeling.

**Lab6:** See worksheet for some answers to questions about the lab. This week didn't include a formal report.

**Lab7 / Independent Project:** Kakapo Mitogenome Analysis For SNP Identification: Investigating Potential Markers of Diversity Within Modern and Historical Populations
